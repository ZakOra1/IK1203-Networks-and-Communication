# Network and Communications Project (IK1203)

## Overview
This project is part of the **IK1203 Networks and Communication** course at KTH. It focuses on understanding and implementing fundamental network communication principles using the **TCP/IP stack**. The tasks involve **socket programming**, **client-server communication**, and **HTTP server development**.

## Tasks
### 1. TCPAsk
- Implements a simple **TCP client** that sends a request to a server and receives a response.

### 2. TCPAsk Connections
- Extends the TCPAsk client to handle **multiple connections** efficiently.

### 3. HTTPAsk Server
- Implements an **HTTP server** capable of processing basic HTTP requests.

### 4. Concurrent HTTPAsk Server
- Enhances the HTTPAsk server to handle **concurrent** client requests using **multi-threading**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Networking**: TCP/IP, HTTP
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threading

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, students gain hands-on experience in:
- Socket programming and network protocols
- Client-server architecture
- HTTP request handling
- Multi-threaded server implementations
